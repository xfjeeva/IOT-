Good question 👍

The code in your image is meant to be used inside TestComplete, an automated testing tool by SmartBear — not in a normal web browser or IDE.

Here’s exactly how you can use it:

🧩 Steps to Run the Script in TestComplete

Step 1:
👉 Open TestComplete on your computer.

Step 2:
👉 Create a new project:

Go to File → New → New Project.

Choose "JavaScript" as the scripting language.


Step 3:
👉 Add a new script file:

In the Project Explorer (left panel), right-click on the "Scripts" folder → choose Add → New Item → select Script.

Give it a name (e.g., Test1).


Step 4:
👉 Paste your code into the script editor:
Copy the function Test1() code from your image and paste it there.

Step 5:
👉 Adjust any variables or URLs:

For example, replace "enter your email" and Project.Variables.Password2 with your actual test data.

Ensure the page structure (Aliases.browser.pageLoginGeeksforgeeks...) matches what TestComplete recorded for your webpage.


Step 6:
👉 Run the test:

Click on the green Run button (or press F5).

TestComplete will launch the browser (Chrome in this case) and execute your script step-by-step.


Step 7:
👉 View Results:
After execution, check the Test Log (bottom panel) for results — it shows passed, failed, and warning messages.

⚙️ Optional (Recording the Test Automatically)

If you prefer not to type the script manually:

1. Create a new project.


2. Click Record Test.


3. Perform actions (open browser, log in, click buttons, etc.).


4. Stop recording — TestComplete will generate the same kind of JavaScript code automatically.
